## Question 31

How can you minimize the impact of consumer group rebalances in a Kafka application?

A. Increase the session timeout value for consumers
B. Reduce the number of partitions for the consumed topics
C. Implement a custom partition assignment strategy
D. Use static group membership for consumers

**Explanation:**
To minimize the impact of consumer group rebalances in a Kafka application, you can use static group membership for consumers. Static group membership allows you to assign a unique identifier to each consumer in the group using the `group.instance.id` configuration. By providing a stable identifier, consumers can maintain their partition assignments across restarts and rebalances. When a consumer with a static group membership rejoins the group after a restart, it will be assigned the same partitions it had before, reducing the need for a full rebalance. This helps in preserving consumer state and avoiding unnecessary partition migrations. Increasing the session timeout value or reducing the number of partitions may help in certain scenarios but does not directly minimize the impact of rebalances. Implementing a custom partition assignment strategy can provide more control over the assignment process but requires additional development effort.

**Answer:** D
