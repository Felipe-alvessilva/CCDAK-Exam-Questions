## KSQL Overview for CCDAK

KSQL, known as ksqlDB in its more recent versions, is a stream processing framework that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka. It uses a SQL-like language, making it accessible to developers familiar with SQL.

### Key Concepts

- **Stream Processing**: Understand how KSQL processes data in real-time, transforming, enriching, and querying data streams.
- **KSQL Syntax**: Familiarity with the SQL-like syntax for creating streams, tables, and performing queries.
- **Streams vs. Tables**: Grasp the difference between a stream (an immutable sequence of records) and a table (a mutable, stateful entity).

### Essential Components

- **KSQL Server**: The server that runs KSQL queries. It interacts with Kafka to execute stream processing applications.
- **KSQL CLI**: The command-line interface to interact with KSQL Server, useful for executing commands and queries.

### Important Commands and Concepts

- **Creating Streams and Tables**: How to define streams and tables over Kafka topics to start processing data.
    ```sql
    CREATE STREAM stream_name (column_name data_type, ...) WITH (kafka_topic='topic_name', value_format='format', ...);
    ```
- **Data Processing**: Understanding of how to perform data transformations, aggregations, and joins using KSQL.
- **Windowing**: Knowledge of windowing functions to process data in time-bound chunks.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Familiarity with using and possibly creating custom functions for specialized processing needs.

### Best Practices

- **Query Optimization**: Tips for optimizing query performance, such as minimizing the use of repartitioning and choosing appropriate keys for joins.
- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Basic practices for monitoring KSQL performance and troubleshooting common issues.
