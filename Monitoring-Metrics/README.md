## Monitoring and Metrics in Kafka

Monitoring and Metrics in Kafka Kafka exposes rich metrics to monitor the health, performance, and utilization metrics of Kafka brokers, producers, and consumers. The ability to obtain these metrics quickly and at scale is vital for troubleshooting and optimizing Kafka cluster .

### Points to Remember for CCDAK on Monitoring and Metrics

- **JMX Integration**: Kafka metrics can be exposed via JMX, allowing integration with monitoring tools.
- **Custom Reporters**: Kafka supports pluggable metrics reporters for flexibility in how metrics are reported and consumed.
- **Performance Tuning**: Metrics are key to identifying bottlenecks and tuning Kafka for optimal performance.
- **Operational Insight**: Monitoring provides insights into Kafka's operational status, including throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

### Important Monitoring and Metrics Properties

#### `kafka.metrics.reporters`
- **Default**: ""
- **Description**: Comma-separated list of classes to report Kafka metrics. These reporters must implement the `kafka.metrics.KafkaMetricsReporter` interface.
- **Trade-offs**: Adding custom reporters can enhance monitoring capabilities but might introduce additional overhead.

#### `metric.reporters`
- **Default**: ""
- **Description**: Comma-separated list of classes to report metrics from producers or consumers. These reporters implement the `org.apache.kafka.common.metrics.MetricsReporter` interface.
- **Trade-offs**: Enables detailed monitoring of producer and consumer metrics, with the trade-off of potential performance impact due to monitoring overhead.

#### `metrics.num.samples`
- **Default**: 2
- **Description**: The number of samples maintained to compute metrics.
- **Trade-offs**: Higher values provide more accurate metrics but can consume more memory.

#### `metrics.sample.window.ms`
- **Default**: 30000 (30 seconds)
- **Description**: The time window associated with each sample. Affects how metrics are calculated over time.
- **Trade-offs**: Larger windows provide smoother metrics over time but may delay detection of spikes or drops in metric values.

#### `metrics.recording.level`
- **Default**: INFO
- **Description**: The highest recording level for metrics in clients. Options are INFO or DEBUG.
- **Trade-offs**: DEBUG provides more granular metrics but can significantly increase the amount of data collected, impacting performance and storage.
