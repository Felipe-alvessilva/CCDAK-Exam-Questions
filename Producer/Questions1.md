## Question 1

What happens when you set `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer?

A. It increases the throughput of the producer
B. It increases the latency of the producer
C. It can lead to out-of-order delivery of messages
D. It has no effect on the producer's behavior

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer allows multiple requests to be sent to the broker in parallel, without waiting for the previous requests to be acknowledged. While this can improve throughput, it also means that if a request fails and needs to be retried, the subsequent requests may have already been processed, leading to out-of-order delivery.

- A is incorrect because while it can improve throughput, it's not the only effect.
- B is incorrect. In fact, it can potentially decrease latency by allowing more requests in flight.
- D is incorrect because it does have a significant effect on the producer's behavior.

## Question 2

What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?

A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When `acks` is set to 0 in a Kafka producer, the producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker before considering the send operation successful. This means the producer will fire and forget the message, providing no guarantees about whether the broker has received it.

- A and B are incorrect because they describe the behaviors of `acks=1` and `acks=all` respectively.
- D is incorrect because no exception is thrown in this case. The producer simply continues sending messages without waiting for acknowledgement.

## Question 3

What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?

A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
C. They should always be set to the same value
D. They are independent and can be set to any value

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, `request.timeout.ms` configures the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server when sending a request, while `delivery.timeout.ms` sets an upper bound on the time to report success or failure to the application after a call to `send()`.

If `delivery.timeout.ms` is smaller than `request.timeout.ms`, the client can time out and report a failure to the application before the request timeout even occurs. Therefore, `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms` to allow the full request timeout to elapse before reporting a timeout failure to the application.

- A is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- C is incorrect because they serve different purposes and can have different values.
- D is incorrect because there is a recommended relationship between the two settings.

## Question 4

A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)

A. `compression.type`
B. `partitioner.class`
C. `bootstrap.servers`
D. `key.serializer`
E. `value.serializer`
F. `client.id`

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**
For a Kafka producer application to function, it must know how to connect to the Kafka cluster and how to serialize the message values. Therefore, the mandatory properties are:

- `bootstrap.servers`: This specifies the list of Kafka brokers the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata.
- `value.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for message values.

The other options are not strictly mandatory:

- A: `compression.type` is optional. If not set, the producer will send uncompressed messages.
- B: `partitioner.class` is optional. If not set, the default partitioner will be used, which is sufficient for messages that don't require a particular order.
- D: `key.serializer` is only required if the messages have keys. It's not mandatory if the messages don't have keys.
- F: `client.id` is optional. It's used to identify the producer application, but the producer will work without it.

## Question 5

What is the purpose of setting `compression.type` in a Kafka producer configuration?

A. To specify the compression algorithm used when sending data to Kafka
B. To specify the compression algorithm used when storing data on Kafka brokers
C. To enable or disable compression for the producer
D. To set the compression level for the producer

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `compression.type` setting in a Kafka producer configuration is used to specify the compression algorithm that the producer will use when sending data to Kafka. The available options are:

- `none`: No compression (default)
- `gzip`: GZIP compression
- `snappy`: Snappy compression
- `lz4`: LZ4 compression
- `zstd`: ZStandard compression

The compression is applied by the producer before sending the data, and the broker will store the compressed data as is. The consumer will decompress the data when it receives it.

- B is incorrect because the broker does not perform compression, it just stores what it receives.
- C is incorrect because `compression.type` does not enable/disable compression, it specifies the algorithm. Compression is enabled by default if an algorithm is specified.
- D is incorrect because `compression.type` sets the algorithm, not the compression level. Some compression types (like `zstd`) have separate settings for compression level.

## Question 6

What is the effect of enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka?

A. Reduced producer memory usage
B. Increased consumer CPU usage
C. Reduced network bandwidth usage
D. Increased end-to-end latency

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka can significantly reduce the amount of network bandwidth used when sending data from the producer to the Kafka brokers. The compressed data takes up less space on the wire, thus reducing network I/O.

However, there are trade-offs:

- A is incorrect because compression actually increases memory usage on the producer side, as the data needs to be held in memory during the compression process.
- B is correct because the consumer will need to use CPU cycles to decompress the data when it receives it.
- D is correct because compression and decompression add some processing time, slightly increasing the end-to-end latency.

So enabling producer compression is a trade-off between network bandwidth and CPU/memory usage. It's most beneficial when network bandwidth is the bottleneck.

## Question 7

What is the relationship between `batch.size` and `linger.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

A. They are mutually exclusive settings
B. `linger.ms` is only relevant if `batch.size` is set to 0
C. `batch.size` is only relevant if `linger.ms` is set to 0
D. They work together to control when a batch is considered ready to send

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In the Kafka producer, `batch.size` and `linger.ms` work together to control when a batch of messages is considered ready to send to the broker:

- `batch.size` sets the maximum amount of data that will be included in a single batch.
- `linger.ms` sets the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker.

A batch will be sent when either `batch.size` is reached or `linger.ms` has passed, whichever comes first.

- A is incorrect because the settings are not mutually exclusive, they work together.
- B and C are incorrect because both settings are always relevant, regardless of the value of the other setting. If `batch.size` is 0, batching is effectively disabled. If `linger.ms` is 0, the producer will not wait at all and will send batches as soon as they are ready.

Tuning these settings can have a significant impact on producer performance and throughput.

## Question 8

What is the effect of increasing `batch.size` in a Kafka producer configuration?

A. It increases the maximum size of each individual message
B. It increases the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single request
C. It increases the maximum time a batch will wait before being sent
D. It increases the maximum amount of memory the producer will use for buffering

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, the `batch.size` setting controls the maximum number of bytes that will be sent in a single request to the broker. By increasing `batch.size`, you allow the producer to pack more messages into each request, which can improve throughput by reducing the overhead of making many smaller requests.

However, there are trade-offs to consider:

- A larger `batch.size` means the producer will buffer more data in memory before sending, which can increase memory usage (D).
- A larger `batch.size` can also increase the latency of message sends, as the producer may wait longer for a batch to fill up before sending.

It's important to note that `batch.size` does not affect the size of individual messages (A), only how many messages can be batched together in a single request. The maximum individual message size is controlled by a separate `max.request.size` setting.

Also, `batch.size` does not directly control the time a batch will wait (C). That is controlled by the `linger.ms` setting.

## Question 9

What is the relationship between `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

A. They are redundant settings that control the same thing
B. `linger.ms` should always be set higher than `request.timeout.ms`
C. `request.timeout.ms` should always be set higher than `linger.ms`
D. They control independent aspects of the producer behavior

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
While `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` both relate to the timing of when the Kafka producer sends data, they control different aspects and their values should be coordinated:

- `linger.ms` controls the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker. A higher value can increase batching and thus throughput, at the cost of some latency.
- `request.timeout.ms` controls the maximum amount of time the producer will wait for a response from the broker before considering the request failed.

It's important that `request.timeout.ms` is set higher than `linger.ms`. If `request.timeout.ms` is lower, the producer might timeout a request before the `linger.ms` period is over, leading to failed sends and potential data loss.

A good rule of thumb is to set `request.timeout.ms` to be at least a few seconds higher than `linger.ms`, to account for potential network or broker latencies on top of the expected linger time.

- A is incorrect because the settings control different things.
- B is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- D is incorrect because while the settings do control independent things, their values should be coordinated.

## Question 10

What happens if `linger.ms` is set to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration?

A. The producer will never send any messages
B. The producer will wait indefinitely for each batch to fill up before sending
C. The producer will send each message as soon as it is received, without batching
D. The producer will use the default linger time

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `linger.ms` to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration means that the producer will not wait at all before sending a batch of messages. In effect, this disables batching: each message will be sent to the broker as soon as it is received by the producer.

This can be useful in scenarios where minimizing latency is more important than maximizing throughput. With `linger.ms=0`, each message is sent immediately, minimizing the time between when a message is produced and when it is available to be consumed.

However, disabling batching can significantly reduce throughput, as the producer will make many more requests to the broker, each carrying fewer messages. This increases the overhead of the request-response cycle.

In most cases, it's recommended to set `linger.ms` to a small but non-zero value, like 5-100ms, to strike a balance between latency and throughput.

- A is incorrect because a linger time of 0 does not prevent the producer from sending messages, it just sends them immediately.
- B is incorrect because a linger time of 0 means the producer won't wait at all, not that it will wait indefinitely.
- D is incorrect because 0 is a valid setting for `linger.ms`, not a signal to use the default.

## Question 11

In the Kafka producer API, what is the purpose of the `acks` configuration parameter?

A. To specify the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete
B. To specify the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful
C. To specify the number of times the producer will retry a failed request
D. To specify the number of partitions a topic must have for the producer to send messages to it

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `acks` parameter in the Kafka producer API controls the durability of writes from the producer to the Kafka broker. It specifies the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.

The valid values for `acks` are:

- 0: The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The message will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent.
- 1: The leader will write the record to its local log and respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. 
- all: The leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record before responding to the producer.

The higher the `acks` value, the stronger the durability guarantee, but also the slower the write performance. 

- B is incorrect because `acks` is about acknowledgments from the leader, not the number of replicas that must acknowledge.
- C is incorrect because `acks` is not related to the number of retries.
- D is incorrect because `acks` is not related to the number of partitions in a topic.

## Question 12

How does the `min.insync.replicas` broker configuration interact with the `acks` producer configuration?

A. They are completely independent settings
B. `acks` must always be set to `all` for `min.insync.replicas` to have any effect
C. `min.insync.replicas` is only relevant if `acks` is set to `1` or `all`
D. If `acks` is set to `all`, writes will only succeed if the number of in-sync replicas is at least `min.insync.replicas`

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The `min.insync.replicas` broker configuration and the `acks` producer configuration work together to control the durability of writes in Kafka:

- `min.insync.replicas` specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful.
- `acks` specifies the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.

When `acks` is set to `all`, the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the write before responding to the producer. However, if the number of in-sync replicas is less than `min.insync.replicas`, the write will fail even if `acks=all`. 

This ensures that a minimum number of replicas have the data, providing a stronger durability guarantee.

- A is incorrect because the settings are not independent, they interact.
- B is incorrect because `min.insync.replicas` can have an effect even if `acks` is not `all`.
- C is incorrect because `min.insync.replicas` is not directly relevant to `acks=1`, only to `acks=all`.

## Question 13

What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message with `acks=all` to a topic partition with 3 replicas, but only 2 replicas are currently in-sync?

A. The write will succeed and the producer will receive an acknowledgment
B. The write will succeed but the producer will not receive an acknowledgment
C. The write will be queued until the third replica comes back in-sync
D. The write will fail and the producer will receive an error

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In this scenario, the producer is configured with `acks=all`, meaning it requires an acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas before considering a write successful. The topic partition has 3 replicas configured, but only 2 are currently in-sync.

When the producer sends a message to this partition, the leader will attempt to replicate the write to all in-sync replicas. However, since the number of in-sync replicas (2) is less than the total number of replicas (3), the leader will not receive acknowledgments from all replicas.

As a result, the write will fail and the producer will receive an error (a `NotEnoughReplicasException`). The message will not be written to the Kafka log.

This behavior protects against data loss by ensuring that writes are only considered successful if they have been durably written to the full set of in-sync replicas.

- A and B are incorrect because the write will not succeed in this scenario.
- C is incorrect because the write will not be queued, it will fail immediately.

## Question 14

Can a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` ever experience data loss?

A. No, this configuration guarantees no data loss under all circumstances
B. Yes, if the total number of replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`
C. Yes, if `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas fail
D. Yes, if the producer crashes after the broker acknowledges the write but before the producer records the acknowledgment

**Answer:** B, C, D

**Explanation:**
While a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` provides a very strong durability guarantee, there are still some edge cases where data loss can occur:

1. If the number of in-sync replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`, the broker will start rejecting writes to that partition. If this happens, and the producer exhausts its retries, the write will fail and the data will be lost. This can happen if replicas crash or become unavailable.

2. If `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas for a partition fail, an out-of-sync replica can be elected as the new leader. This replica may be missing some of the latest messages, causing data loss.

3. If the producer crashes (or loses connectivity) after the broker acknowledges a write but before the producer records the acknowledgment, the producer will treat the write as failed and may retry it. This can lead to duplicate messages, but from the perspective of the crashed producer instance, the original message is lost.

So while `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` provide a very strong durability guarantee, they cannot completely eliminate the possibility of data loss in all failure scenarios.

- A is incorrect because, as explained above, there are edge cases where data loss can still occur even with this configuration.

## Question 15

You want to produce messages to a Kafka topic using a Java client. Which of the following is NOT a required configuration for the producer?

A. `bootstrap.servers`
B. `key.serializer`
C. `value.serializer`
D. `partitioner.class`

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
When creating a Kafka producer in Java, there are several required configurations:

- `bootstrap.servers`: This specifies the list of broker addresses the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata. It is required for the producer to know where to send requests.
- `key.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for keys. It is required because Kafka needs to know how to serialize the key object to bytes.
- `value.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for values. It is required because Kafka needs to know how to serialize the value object to bytes.

The `partitioner.class` configuration is optional. It specifies the partitioner class that should be used to determine which partition to send each message to. If not specified, the default partitioner will be used, which is sufficient for most use cases.

## Question 16

Which of the following is true about the relationship between producers and consumers in Kafka?

A. Producers and consumers must use the same serialization format
B. Producers and consumers must be written in the same programming language
C. Producers and consumers are decoupled by the Kafka topic
D. Producers must know about the consumers to send messages to them

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
One of the key design principles of Kafka is the decoupling of producers and consumers:

- Producers write messages to a Kafka topic, without needing to know about the consumers that will read those messages.
- Consumers read messages from a Kafka topic, without needing to know about the producers that wrote those messages.

This decoupling is achieved through the Kafka topic, which acts as a buffer between producers and consumers. Producers write to the topic and consumers read from the topic, but they don't need to be aware of each other.

This decoupling allows for several benefits:

- Producers and consumers can be scaled independently, as they are not directly dependent on each other.
- Producers and consumers can be written in different programming languages and use different serialization formats, as long as they agree on the data format of the messages in the topic.
- New consumers can be added to read from the topic without affecting the producers.

Therefore, statements A, B, and D are incorrect. Producers and consumers do not need to use the same serialization format, be written in the same language, or know about each other. They are decoupled by the Kafka topic.

## Question 17

What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message to a topic partition and does not receive an acknowledgment from the broker?

A. The producer will consider the message as successfully sent
B. The producer will wait indefinitely for the acknowledgment
C. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration
D. The producer will immediately send the next message in the queue

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When a Kafka producer sends a message, it waits for an acknowledgment from the broker before considering the send operation complete. If the acknowledgment is not received within the configured `request.timeout.ms`, the send operation is considered failed.

In case of a failure, the producer's behavior depends on its `retries` configuration:

- If `retries` is set to 0, the producer will not retry the send operation. It will consider the message as failed and will either throw an exception or invoke the callback function with an error, depending on how the send operation was invoked.
- If `retries` is set to a value greater than 0, the producer will retry sending the message up to the specified number of times. It will wait for `retry.backoff.ms` before each retry attempt.

If the producer exhausts all retry attempts without receiving an acknowledgment, it will consider the message as failed.

Therefore, statement C is correct. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration.

- A is incorrect because the producer will not consider the message as successfully sent until it receives an acknowledgment.
- B is incorrect because the producer will not wait indefinitely. It will timeout after `request.timeout.ms`.
- D is incorrect because the producer will not immediately send the next message. It will attempt to retry the failed message first.
