## Question 21

How does Kafka's zero-copy optimization handle data transformation or modification?

A. It automatically applies data transformations during the zero-copy process.
B. It allows custom data transformations to be plugged into the zero-copy mechanism.
C. It does not support data transformations and sends data as-is.
D. It performs data transformations after the data is copied into the application's memory.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Kafka's zero-copy optimization is designed to efficiently transfer data between the producer and consumer without any data transformation or modification. When using zero-copy, Kafka sends the data as-is, exactly as it was received from the producer, without applying any transformations.

Here's how Kafka handles data transformation with zero-copy:

1. Producer-side serialization:
   - Before sending data to Kafka, the producer application serializes the data into a format suitable for transmission, such as byte arrays or specific serialization formats like Avro or Protobuf.
   - The producer is responsible for any necessary data transformations or modifications before serialization.

2. Zero-copy data transfer:
   - When the producer sends the serialized data to Kafka, Kafka uses zero-copy optimization to transfer the data directly from the file system cache to the network buffer.
   - During this zero-copy process, Kafka does not perform any data transformations or modifications.
   - The data is sent as-is, exactly as it was received from the producer.

3. Consumer-side deserialization:
   - When the consumer receives the data from Kafka, it needs to deserialize the data from the network format back into the application's format.
   - The consumer is responsible for any necessary data transformations or modifications after deserialization.

Kafka's zero-copy optimization focuses on efficient data transfer and does not include built-in mechanisms for data transformation (option A). It also does not provide a pluggable framework for custom data transformations during the zero-copy process (option B).

If data transformations are required, they should be performed by the producer before sending the data to Kafka and by the consumer after receiving the data from Kafka (option D). This allows the zero-copy optimization to work efficiently by transferring data as-is, without any modifications.
