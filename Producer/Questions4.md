## Question 31

What does the `acks=all` setting in the Kafka producer configuration ensure?

A. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all replicas
B. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to the leader replica
C. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas
D. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment and will consider the write successful immediately

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas (ISRs). In-sync replicas are the replicas that are currently up-to-date with the leader and are considered to have the latest data. Setting `acks=all` ensures the highest level of durability, as the producer will wait for the message to be persisted on multiple replicas before considering the write successful. However, this setting also introduces additional latency, as the producer needs to wait for acknowledgments from all ISRs before proceeding.

**Answer:** C

## Question 32

What is the purpose of the `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations?

A. To specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster
B. To set the maximum number of requests the client can send or receive
C. To determine the compression type used for message production or consumption
D. To control the maximum amount of memory the client can use for buffering

**Explanation:**
The `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations is used to specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster. It is an optional setting that helps in identifying and tracking the client's activity in the cluster. When set, the `client.id` is included in the metadata of requests sent by the client, making it easier to correlate and monitor client behavior. It can be useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to identify specific clients in the logs and metrics. The `client.id` does not have any impact on the functional behavior of the client, such as the number of requests, compression type, or memory usage. It is purely used for identification and monitoring purposes.

**Answer:** A

## Question 33

What happens if multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value?

A. The clients will share the same configuration and connection pooling
B. The clients will be treated as a single logical client by the Kafka brokers
C. The behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors
D. The Kafka brokers will reject the connection attempts from clients with duplicate `client.id`

**Explanation:**
If multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value, the behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors. The `client.id` is meant to be a unique identifier for each client, and Kafka brokers do not enforce uniqueness or perform any special handling when multiple clients have the same `client.id`. Using the same `client.id` for multiple clients can cause confusion and make it difficult to distinguish between the activities of different clients in logs and metrics. It may also lead to incorrect correlation of requests and responses, as the brokers may attribute the actions of one client to another. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to assign a unique `client.id` to each Kafka client in a cluster.

**Answer:** C
