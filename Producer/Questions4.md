## Question 31

What does the `acks=all` setting in the Kafka producer configuration ensure?

A. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all replicas
B. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to the leader replica
C. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas
D. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment and will consider the write successful immediately

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas (ISRs). In-sync replicas are the replicas that are currently up-to-date with the leader and are considered to have the latest data. Setting `acks=all` ensures the highest level of durability, as the producer will wait for the message to be persisted on multiple replicas before considering the write successful. However, this setting also introduces additional latency, as the producer needs to wait for acknowledgments from all ISRs before proceeding.

**Answer:** C
