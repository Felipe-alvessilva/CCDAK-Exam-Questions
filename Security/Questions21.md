## Question 21

What is the purpose of the `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka SASL authentication?

A. To specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM)
B. To configure the SASL client and server callbacks for authentication
C. To set the path to the JAAS configuration file for SASL authentication
D. To enable or disable SASL authentication in Kafka

**Explanation:**
The `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka is used to specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) is a framework that provides authentication and optional encryption for network protocols. Kafka supports multiple SASL mechanisms, such as PLAIN, SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism), and GSSAPI (Kerberos). The `sasl.mechanism` configuration allows you to choose the specific SASL mechanism that Kafka should use for authentication. For example, setting `sasl.mechanism=PLAIN` configures Kafka to use the PLAIN mechanism, which transmits credentials in plaintext. Setting `sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256` configures Kafka to use the SCRAM mechanism with SHA-256 hashing for secure password-based authentication. The available SASL mechanisms depend on the Kafka version and the security libraries installed.
